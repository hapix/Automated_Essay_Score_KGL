I will be explaining how the \"face\" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.\\n\\nFirst off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.\\n\\nNext, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It\\'s just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?\\n\\nFinaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i\\'ve been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the \"face\" is just a landform.\\n\\nTo sum all this up the \"face\" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it\\'s a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it\\'s a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def removeHTML(x):\n    html=re.compile(r'<.*?>')\n    return html.sub(r'',x)\ndef dataPreprocessing(x):\n    # 将单词转化为小写\n    # Convert words to lowercase\n    x = x.lower()\n    # Remove HTML\n    # 移除html\n    x = removeHTML(x)\n    # 删除以@作为首字母的字符串\n    # Delete strings starting with @\n    x = re.sub(\"@\\w+\", '',x)\n    # 删除数字\n    # Delete Numbers\n    x = re.sub(\"'\\d+\", '',x)\n    x = re.sub(\"\\d+\", '',x)\n    # 删除网址\n    # Delete URL\n    x = re.sub(\"http\\w+\", '',x)\n    # 将连续空白符替换为一个空格字符\n    # Replace consecutive empty spaces with a single space character\n    x = re.sub(r\"\\s+\", \" \", x)\n    # 替换连续的句号和逗号为一个\n    # Replace consecutive commas and periods with one comma and period character\n    x = re.sub(r\"\\.+\", \".\", x)\n    x = re.sub(r\"\\,+\", \",\", x)\n    # 去除开头结尾的空白符\n    # Remove empty characters at the beginning and end\n    x = x.strip()\n    return x","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T20:54:37.139192Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T20:54:37.139605Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T20:54:37.157663Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-10T20:54:37.139575Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T20:54:37.156138Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Maybe cheking the level of the grammer could also help us.\n* Sentiment analysis.\n* Check the coherence and clarity.\n* Language style.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
